## How to open an Issue

 1. Go to [the project's issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/plaza-project/plaza-core/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=). 
 2. Select the `Bug` template for bug reports or `New Feature` for feature proposals.
 3. Give the issue an appropriate title.
 4. Fill the sections on the issue description.
 5. `Submit` the issue


## How to develop a new feature or fix

 1. Open an issue proposing the feature/fix. Alternatively send a comment to one where it's proposed but no one assigned asking for clarifications.
 2. After a goal or design has been agreed, [fork the repository](https://gitlab.com/plaza-project/plaza-core/-/forks/new). You can `git clone` your fork and develop on there. Consider creating a new branch on your local clone for this development, if you were developing a "Dark mode theme", you could create a new branch with ` git checkout -b dark-mode-theme `.
 3. Develop the feature or fix.
 4. After the development is completed, commit and push the changes.
 5. Open a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.com/plaza-project/plaza-core/merge_requests/new), select your repository and branch on the **source branch** column and `plaza-project/plaza-core` and `develop` on the **target branch**.

With these, your feature or fix is sent for review. We'll do our best to answer as soon as possible, but keep in mind that in some cases it might take some time.
